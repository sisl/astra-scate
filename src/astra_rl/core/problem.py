"""
A "Problem" is one of the core abstractions in Astra RL, defining how to interact
with the system under test. The interface is defined by the `Problem` class, which
defines a set of abstract methods that users must implement to create a custom problem.
This provides flexibility in terms of how users can define their own applications
while still adhering to a common interface that enables the Astra RL framework
to function correctly.
