## 🧹 What Was Cleaned Up

### Files Moved to `examples/output/`:
- **Demo outputs**: `demo_*.png`, `demo_*.json`
- **Dashboard files**: `demo_dashboard/`
- **Metrics data**: `demo_metrics/`, `integration_metrics/`
- **Results data**: `demo_results/`
- **Performance plots**: `integration_performance_analysis.png`
- **Training logs**: `*.log` files

### Files Moved to `examples/demos/`:
- **Demo scripts**: All `*_demo.py` files
- **Demo config**: `mypy.ini` for demos

### Directories Organized:
- **`examples/output/checkpoints/`** - Model checkpoints
- **`examples/output/results/`** - Training results  
- **`examples/output/logs/`** - Training logs
- **`examples/output/demos/`** - Demo-specific outputs

## 🚀 Updated Demo Scripts

All demo scripts have been updated to use the new organized structure:

### Before:
```python
tracker = MetricsTracker("demo_run", "demo_metrics")
monitor.plot_training_progress("demo_training_progress.png")
```

### After:
```python
tracker = MetricsTracker("demo_run", "examples/output/demo_metrics")
monitor.plot_training_progress("examples/output/demo_training_progress.png")
```

## 🛠️ New Tools Created

### 1. Cleanup Script
**`scripts/cleanup_demo_outputs.sh`**
- Automatically organizes demo outputs
- Moves files to proper locations
- Cleans up empty directories
- Provides organized structure

### 2. Examples Documentation
**`examples/README.md`**
- Complete guide to examples and demos
- Directory structure explanation
- Running instructions
- Prerequisites and notes

## ✅ Verification

The cleanup was verified by running the monitoring and evaluation demo:

```bash
cd /home/kjafari/astra-scate
PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/demos/monitoring_evaluation_demo.py
```

**Result**: ✅ All outputs properly saved to `examples/output/` structure!

## 📋 Benefits

1. **Clean Main Directory**: No more scattered demo files
2. **Organized Structure**: Logical separation of examples and outputs
3. **Easy Navigation**: Clear directory hierarchy
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to find and manage files
5. **Scalable**: Structure supports future growth

## 🔄 Future Maintenance

### To Clean Up After Running Demos:
```bash
./scripts/cleanup_demo_outputs.sh
```

### To Run Demos:
```bash
# Basic examples
python3 examples/ast_basic.py

# Comprehensive demos  
python3 examples/demos/monitoring_evaluation_demo.py
```

### All Outputs Go To:
```
examples/output/
├── checkpoints/     # Model checkpoints
├── results/         # Training results
├── logs/           # Training logs
└── *.png, *.json   # Visualization files
```

## 🎯 Status: COMPLETE

The SCATE project directory is now:
- ✅ **Clean and organized**
- ✅ **Properly structured**
- ✅ **Easy to navigate**
- ✅ **Ready for development**
- ✅ **Demo outputs organized**

All demo files, outputs, and temporary files have been moved to their proper locations, and the main directory is clean and organized!
