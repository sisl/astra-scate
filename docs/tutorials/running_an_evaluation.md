# Running An Evaluation

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running an evaluation using an existing evaluator model. The evaluator is a model that can be used to assess the quality of other models' outputs. 

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume that you have already trained an evaluator model from the [Training an Evaluator](training_an_evaluator.md) tutorial.mk
